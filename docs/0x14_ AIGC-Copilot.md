## What’s GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot provides autocomplete-style suggestions from an AI pair programmer as you code. You can receive suggestions from GitHub Copilot either by starting to write the code you want to use, or by writing a natural language comment describing what you want the code to do.

- AI 结对编程工具
- 超大规模预训练模型
- GPT-3.5
- Prompt 引擎
## Powered by OpenAI

It is powered by OpenAI Codex to work in real time, right from your editor. GitHub Copilot improves developer productivity and happiness, reducing disruptions, improving flow and increasing the amount of time a developer spends doing satisfying work.
Unlike other code assistants, GitHub Copilot offers suggestions from a model that OpenAI built from billions of lines of open source code.
## What can you do with GitHub Copilot?

**Github Copilot 具体功能如下：**

- **Copilot** 能根据编程者已写出的上下文生成匹配的代码；
- 给出函数名和参数，**Copilot** 就能自动补全代码；
- **Copilot** 能根据一条描述代码逻辑的注释自动生成代码；
- **Copilot** 可以将简单重复的代码编写部分自动化；
- **Copilot** 可以用于协助软件测试，导入一个软件测试包，其余测试代码 **Copilot** 就能够自动补全
- 同一个函数有多种实现方法，**Copilot** 可以提供多种方法供编程者选择
### Convert comments to code 

GitHub Copilot uses a special version of GPT-3 that has been trained on a large body of public source code. It is as good at writing natural language as it is at writing code, so in fact it can complete your comments for you. In the example below, we first let it complete our explanation, and then, line by line, we tab through the code that does what we just said in English.
